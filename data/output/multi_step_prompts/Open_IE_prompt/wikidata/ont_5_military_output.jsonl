in that case,\n      choose the most appropriate subject_type and object_type concept labels from the ontology, but do not discard the triple.\n    - Return JSON only, with this schema\n        {\n          \"triples\": [\n            {\n              \"triple\": [\"subject\",\"relation\",\"object\"],\n              \"subject_type\": \"Concept\",\n              \"object_type\": \"Concept\",\n              \"support\": \"exact quote from text\",\n              \"confidence\": 0.0\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n    - The confidence must be a real value between 0 and 1, estimated by how clearly the text supports the triple,\n      and how well subject_type and object_type match the ontology types.\n\n\n\nOne-shot EXAMPLE (for guidance;
